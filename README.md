# php-recommendation-system

Using the MovieLens database, I took the data and made 3 algorithms that will recommend a movie to an user. You can download the database set here:  https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ or just use the database I provided ( from 100k ratings only a few where processed, if you run the scripts longer you will get better results, and maybe dont use PHP for this task haha. I may in the future write some program to proccess better the data, dont have the time right now )

## 1 method:
Genre based recommendations

## 2 method:
Collaborative filtering ( non personalized )

## 3 method:
Collaborative filtering ( personalized )

## Warning
Dont take this code too serious
